## TODO
- [ ] General
    - [x] Cleanup repo (remove unnecessary files, automate testing, etc.)
    - [x] Graceful error handling
    - [ ] `join` operations between contexts
    - [x] Trait/Lang separation cleanup
    - [ ] Propogate requirements across variables (i.e. `y = x;` & `x != 0;` therefore `y != 0;`)
- [ ] Language
    - [x] Better import handling (`foundry.toml` reading?)
    - [x] User Types, i.e. `type MyType is uint256;`
    - [x] Better Library handling
    - [x] Operator overloading
    - [ ] Storage
        - [ ] Consider constructor
        - [ ] Consider non-constructor initializer
    - [x] Functions
        - [x] Call modifier at start of function analysis
        - [x] Call modifiers when calling another function from within a function
        - [x] Handle virtual/overriding
    - [x] Consider `unchecked` math
        - [x] Keep uncheckedness for the entire block
        - [x] Pass uncheckedness into `bin_op`
    - [x] Support `assembly`
    - [ ] Improve Support for `for/while` loops
        - [ ] Be smarter about the variables by looking at max num of iters and determine if we should just unroll & execute it
        - [ ] Take a guess at the gas usage inside the body of the for-loop and try to set upper bounds
    - [x] Support `++i/i++/--i/i++`
    - [x] Support low-level call
- [ ] Analyzers
    - [x] Bound Analyzer
        - [x] Cleanup CLI output
        - [x] Fix multiple calls to single function that don't show
